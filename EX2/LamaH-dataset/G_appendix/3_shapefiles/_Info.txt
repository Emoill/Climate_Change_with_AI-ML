Information for Impacts.shp:

The features in this shapefile allocate the (anthropogenic) impacts on runoff process and measurement (attribute "typimpact" in Table 1) based on basin delineation B. 
Impacts are thereby assigned only once, although they may still affect downstream gauges. 
It should be noted that impacts do not necessarily have to be located in the same basin (e.g. storage power plant with cross-basin water transfer).

Attributes:
ID --> enables connection to the corresponding gauge/basin
no --> individual number, no further meaning
typimpact --> type of impact, see chapter 5.8 in paper
GRAND_ID --> Dam-ID from the GRanD dataset (Lehner et al., 2011)
DAM_ID --> Dam-ID from the GOODD dataset (Mulligan et al., 2020)
