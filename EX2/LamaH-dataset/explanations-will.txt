Gauge - measuring device at a specific point
Basin - the area of all water that flows to a specific point
	- formally: "topographic catchment area of a gauge"


folder structure: (left out files that don't seem important)

A - measured by the total amount of water that passes through the gauge
	1 - attributes
		* Catchment_attributes - statistics about each gauge's basin
		* Stream_dist          - distance from the farthest origin to the gauge
		* Water_balance        - information about average rainfall at each gauge
	2 - timeseries/daily
		* each gauge has a file of measurements there over time (rain, temperature, sun)
B - measured by the difference between a gauge & all gauges immediately upstream from it
	1 - attributes
		* Catchment_attributes       - same as before, except by this definition the basin is smaller
		                         & no longer overlaps with other gauges
		* Crossbasin_water_transfers - amount of water that moves between the basins?????
		                               (i don't actually understand this one)
		* Gauge-hierarchy            - shows which basins are further downstream from others
		* Stream_dist                - distance to next gauge downstream
	2 - timeseries/daily
		* same as before
C - same as B, except highly correlated gauges are merged together (to the downstream)
D - information about each gauge.
