what models to use?

Instructions:
> Model: At least four types of models â€“ time series/ Neural networks (NNs) Depp NNs (DNNs)/ regression models and any other variants

ideas
1. ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model
2. LSTM (long short term memory) - a type of RNN (recurrent neural network)
3. Gated Recurrent units (GRUs) - also a type of RNN
4. Prophet - additive linear model for timeseries data
